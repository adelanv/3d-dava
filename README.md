<h1> 3D-DaVa Package </h1>

3D-DaVa is a Python-based package that offers point cloud (3D) data validation for an array of industrial products, allowing no-reference and full-reference point cloud quality assessments. Compared to other quality assessment tools, which often output use-case specific metrics, 3D-DaVa can offer a more general approach, covering three data quality dimensions. Accuracy quantifies the presence of noise. Validity quantifies the presence of outliers. Completeness quantifies the absence of expected values. 3D-DaVa provides a couple other functionalities, such as stitching point clouds together and denoising point clouds. A non-automatic setting of the pipeline allows user involvement, not only by applying a weighing scheme to highlight desired properties, but also to refine the assessment process.

Implementation backbone: Open3D


<h2> Installation Guide </h2>

To use 3D-DaVa, first follow the installation steps:

Anaconda and Git are required prior to package installation !

Installation steps:

1. Via Git: clone repository locally using either the HTTPS or SSH-key using the command:

    git clone <ADD HTTPS/SSH-KEY>

2. You should now have a ProjectClouds folder containing all necessary files. Change location to the ProjectClouds folder through your Anaconda Prompt terminal.

3. In the Anaconda Prompt, create the conda environment. This can be done in two ways, we recommend alternative 2 while the package is under work.

Alternative 1. Create environment from the environment.yml file by entering:

    conda env create -f environment.yml

Alternative 2. Create a new environment by entering:

    conda create -n 3d-dava python=3.9

In the new environment, manually install the following packages: open3d, matplotlib, scikit-learn, scipy, pandas.

4. Verify environment creation by entering the line below. 3d-dava should be listed:

    conda env list

5. Activate environment by entering:

    conda activate 3d-dava

6. Whilst in the ProjectClouds directory, run the following to install 3D-DaVa package:

    python3 -m pip install .

7. The 3D-DaVa package should now be locally installed. You can verify this by checking if 3d-dava is present in the activated environment by entering:

    conda list


<h2> Usage </h2>

You can use the package directly from the Anaconda command line.

<h3> No Reference Data Validation </h3>

Data validation using only the intrinsic properties of the digitized point cloud. Returns a .json file containing the quality scores based on these.

    python -m 3D_DaVa processing [-h] [-o OUTPUT] cloud_file

Arguments:

**cloud_file**: point cloud file to be asessed (recommended format: .ply, see notes).

**-h, –help**: (Optional) show arguments

**-vis, --visualize**: (Optional) allow visualization of process steps

**-snap, --snapshot**: (Optional) allow snapshotting of process steps

**-o OUTPUT, –output OUTPUT**: (Optional) filename of metric-filled output file. No file extension needed (automatically turned to .json)

**-save, –-save**: (Optional) allow saving the denoised point cloud as a (.pcd file) on current path. (Obs: TODO)

**-auto, –-automatic**: (Optional) runs the pipeline without user intervenstion.

<h3> Reference-based Data Validation </h3>

Data validation using both the no-reference and the reference-based assessment of the digitized point cloud and metrics resulting from the alignment with a reference model. Returns a .json file containing the quality scores based on these.

    python -m 3D_DaVa processing [-h]  [-o OUTPUT] cloud_file -r REFERENCE

Arguments:

**cloud_file**: point cloud file to be asessed (recommended format: .ply, see notes).

**-h, –help**: (Optional) show arguments

**-vis, --visualize**: (Optional) allow visualization of process steps

**-snap, --snapshot**: (Optional) allow snapshotting of process steps

**-r REFERENCE**, –reference REFERENCE: reference file (recommended format: .stl, see notes)

**-o OUTPUT, –output OUTPUT**: (Optional) filename of metric-filled output file. No file extension needed (automatically turned to .json)

**-save, –-save**: (Optional) allow saving the denoised point cloud as a (.pcd file) on current path. (Obs: TODO)

**-auto, –-automatic**: (Optional) runs the pipeline without user intervenstion.


<h3> Stitching </h3>

Fuses together several point clouds into a single point cloud, if necessary. This is a typical step when we have more digitized point clouds of the same object. For now we assume that the scale and orientation are the same for all point clouds involved.

    python -m 3D_DaVa stitching [-h] [-o OUTPUT] directory_path

Arguments:

**directory_path**: absolute path of directory containing point clouds (recommended format: .ply, see notes).

**-h, –help**: (Optional) show arguments

**-o OUTPUT, –output OUTPUT**: (Optional) name of stitched point cloud file
